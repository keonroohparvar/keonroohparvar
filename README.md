Hello! My name is Keon Roohparvar, and I am a graduate of Cal Poly SLO with a Master's of Science degree in Computer Science.

My technical interests include:
* Deep Learning
* Generative AI
  * Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion, Latent Diffusion, etc.)
  * Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* Computer Vision

On a more personal note, some of my hobbies include:
* Piano - I have a piano page on Instagram @keonspianopage; feel free to check it out!
* Music Production - I have made some Lofi beats with some piano and guitar - Lofi is the perfect music for programmers, so check it out at @Geevoo on Spotify :) 
* 3-D Printing - I (attempt to) make small things for various around-the-house needs on SolidWorks, and I print them on my Ender 3 printer. 

Please feel free to contact me at kroohpar@gmail.com, and let me know if you have any questions about my projects!
