Hey there, I'm Keon Roohparvar! I'm currently the Chief ML Engineer at a startup where I'm leading the charge on some truly revolutionary AI—redesigning neural networks on our custom silicon hardware to drastically cut down global AI energy consumption [see website here](https://roogen.ai). 

My technical journey began at Cal Poly SLO, where I earned both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science, focusing on Artificial Intelligence. After graduating, I worked as a MLE at Apple for 1.5 years working on testing the Cameras using ML/CV algorithms.

🚀 My tech interests include:
- Deep Learning
- Generative AI (especially Diffusion Models like Stable Diffusion and Latent Diffusion)
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

🎹 When I'm not coding, you can find me:
- Playing Piano 🎶 – check out my piano adventures on Instagram @keonspianopage.
- Producing Music 🎧 – I love creating chill Lofi beats infused with piano and guitar. Great music for coding! Listen to my EP on Spotify @Geevoo.
- 3D Printing 🖨️ – I design and print practical (and sometimes impractical) creations around the house using SolidWorks and my trusty Ender 3.

📬 Feel free to reach out at kroohpar@gmail.com – I'm always happy to chat about projects, collaborations, or absolutely anything else (I really can't help myself sometimes, I might need help)!
